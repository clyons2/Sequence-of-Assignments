# I started with the random.uniform function which allowed for a three digit number to be generated, not including decimals, within a set range of numbers. Then using the math.floor function, the randomly generated numbers were rounded down making the numbers three digit integers. Lastly the larger range was assigned to minuend and the smaller range to subtrahend.

import random
import math

# A sequence of assignments to generate a random problem:
minuend = math.floor(random.uniform(500, 999))
subtrahend = math.floor(random.uniform(100, 499))
answer = minuend - subtrahend

print('Problem: {minuend} - {subtrahend} = ?'.format(minuend = minuend, subtrahend = subtrahend))
print('Answer: {answer}'.format(answer = answer))
