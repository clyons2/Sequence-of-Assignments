# I started with the random.randrange function for minuend, which generated a random three-digit integer within the given range that is a multiple of 10.
# For subtrahend the random.randint functions which allowed for a three-digit integer to be generated within a set range of numbers. 
# The conditional ensures that borrowing is necessary.

# A sequence of assignments to generate a random problem:
minuend = random.randrange(500, 999, 10)  # Generates a random integer within the range and is a multiple of 10
subtrahend = random.randint(100, 499) # Generates a random integer within the range
if minuend % 10 == subtrahend % 10: # Checks the "one's" position of both numbers to ensure borrowing in necessary
  subtrahend += 1 
answer = minuend - subtrahend # Calculates the difference

print('Problem: {minuend} - {subtrahend} = ?'.format(minuend = minuend, subtrahend = subtrahend)) # Prints the subtraction question
print('Answer: {answer}'.format(answer = answer)) # Prints the answer to the subtraction
