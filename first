# The random.randrange function is used for minuend to which generated a random three-digit integer within the given range that is a multiple of 10.
# For subtrahend the random.randint function is used. This allows for a three-digit integer to be generated within a set range of numbers that is a multiple of 9. 


import random

# A sequence of assignments to generate a random problem:
minuend = random.randrange(500, 999, 10)  # Generates a random integer within the range and is a multiple of 10
subtrahend = random.randrange(199, 279, 9) # Generates a random integer within the range and is a multiple of 9

answer = minuend - subtrahend # Calculates the difference

print('Problem: {minuend} - {subtrahend} = ?'.format(minuend = minuend, subtrahend = subtrahend)) # Prints the subtraction question
print('Answer: {answer}'.format(answer = answer)) # Prints the answer to the subtraction
