# I started with the random.randrange function for minuend, which generated a random three-digit integer within the given range that is a multiple of 10.
# For subtrahend the random.randint functions which allowed for a three-digit integer to be generated within a set range of numbers. 
# The conditional ensures that borrowing is necessary.

# A sequence of assignments to generate a random problem:

if minuend % 10 == subtrahend % 10:
  subtrahend += 1
answer = minuend - subtrahend

print('Answer: {answer}'.format(answer = answer))
